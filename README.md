# The Retail Store Discounts
This project aims to streamline the billing process in retail stores, providing accurate discount calculations and enhancing the customer shopping experience.

# Overview
The Retail Store Billing System is designed to manage and automate the billing process within a retail store, ensuring that customers receive the appropriate discounts based on specific criteria. The system applies various discounts to the total bill amount, depending on the customer's relationship with the store and the type of products purchased.

# Key Features
Employee Discount: If the user is an employee of the store, they receive a 30% discount on non-grocery items.

Affiliate Discount: If the user is an affiliate of the store, they receive a 10% discount on non-grocery items.

Loyalty Discount: If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, they receive a 5% discount on non-grocery items.

Flat Discount: For every $100 spent on the bill, the user receives a $5 discount.

Grocery Exclusion: Percentage-based discounts do not apply to grocery items.

Single Percentage Discount: A user can only receive one of the percentage-based discounts on a bill.

# Components

# User Management
Users can be classified as employees, affiliates, or regular customers.
The system tracks user details including their type and subscription date.

# Product Management
Products are categorized into different types such as grocery and non-grocery items.
Each product has an identifier, name, price, and category.
